<p>I'm a software developer by day and a serial hobbyist by night. I've started writing on this site to drive myself to be more creative. Writing an article on a periodic basis will force exploration of new ideas and force me to take initiative. </p>
<p>Some background: I'm a Full Stack developer working for <a href="https://www.proplogix.com">PropLogix</a>, a real estate intelligence company based in sunny Sarasota, Florida. We're working with ASP.NET WebAPI and an AngularJS front-end to drive our line of business application. I've always been a Microsoft guy, so I'm quite comfortable here, but I am always looking to learn new things. </p>
<p>I'm a serial hobbyist, a 'maker' if you will. Aside from programming, I thoroughly enjoy woodworking, electrical engineering, computer networking, lasers, chemistry, and high voltage (to name a few). Fitting all of the above into a spare bedroom in an apartment with a wife and two dogs has been a challenge, but has proven do-able.</p>
<p>On this site, I plan to write about my adventures in the topics above and many more. While I do my absolute best to present factual information and best-practices, I am aware that at times something may be simply wrong. If you stumble upon one of these occurrences, let me know. </p>
